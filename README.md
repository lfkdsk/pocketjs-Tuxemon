# Pocket Tuxemon

[Tuxemon](https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon)'s world — its maps, events,
characters and dialogue — imported into
[Pocket RPG Kit](https://github.com/lfkdsk/pocket-rpgkit) and played on
[PocketJS](https://github.com/pocket-nexus/pocketjs) (desktop, web, PSP).

Work in progress. The importer reads a pinned Tuxemon checkout
(`bun run fetch:tuxemon`, commit `9e6258ff`) and writes
`rpgkit-project/v1` documents and baked art into this repository.
